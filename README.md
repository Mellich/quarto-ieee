`quarto-ieee` use the `IEEEtran.cls` document class that is used for most IEEE transaction articles.
It supports both `PDF` and `HTML` output.

## Creating a New Article

```

This will create a new directory with an example document that uses this format.

## Using with an Existing Document

To add this format to an existing document:


``` bash
quarto add dfolio/quarto-ieee
```

Then, add the format to your document options:

``` yaml

  ieee-pdf: default
```

Most basic `IEEEtran.cls` command are supported.
There are some (few) limitations for the `HTML` output.

For the  `HTML` output, `quarto-ieee` tries to mimic as closely as possible the layout seen on IEEEXplore^速^.

## Example

[IEEEtran.cls]: https://ctan.org/pkg/ieeetran "Document class for IEEE Transactions journals and conferences"


You can view a preview of the rendered basic template at [template.pdf](template.pdf) or  [template.html](template.html).
